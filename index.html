            The origins of NYC go as far back as Fort Amsterdam and a Dutch trading post in southern Manhattan in 1624. In 1626, the settlement's name was New Amsterdam, and it
            <br> became a city in 1653. However, the city fell under British control in 1664; King Charles ll gave the land to his brother, the Duke of York, ultimately changing the name of
            <br> the city from New Amsterdam to New York City. New York City was actually the capital of the United States through the years 1785-1790. Ever since NYC was gifted the
            <br> Statue of Liberty in 1885, the city has welcomed millions of immigrants to America through Ellis Island, creating the culturally and ethnically diverse NYC that I live in today.
